2 what are meta tags



Answer
1 Metadata is data (information) about data.

<meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.
Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services.
